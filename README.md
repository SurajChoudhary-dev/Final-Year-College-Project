# Final-Year-College-Project
A Novel Two Layer Encryption Algorithm Using One-Time Pad and DNA Cryptography


This project deals with the development of a secure genetic 
algorithmic system to transfer data that is of extreme importance of 
the internet in a very secure way. The idea is two implement two 
levels of encryption that too with a very random making it secure 
and allowing more and more and people to have a believer in online 
transaction, Genetic Algorithm is a powerful tool that has makes the 
process lot more secure, The randomness of the algorithm make it 
hard to crack it. Therefore, creating a more community where people 
trust in the sharing the most confidential details online through these 
secure means.
