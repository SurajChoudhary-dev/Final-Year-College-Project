The program being executed on a machine shows the following result, we can
clearly see that this method is fast and quite secure .Implementing this we can
achieve this result. The time taken for the word "CRYPTOGRAPHY" is 0.11
sec and the same thing was run on Network which resulted in 0.06 sec.


Test 1:
Input:-   network

Output:-   
LEVEL 1 ENCRYPTION:    EFGLSYL
LEVEL 2 ENCRYPTION:    GAGG GAGC GAGT GATA GGAT GGCG GATA
LEVEL 2 ENCRYPTION:    EFGLSYL
LEVEL 1 ENCRYPTION:    NETWORK
